            <h2>Challenges</h2>
<p><b>Loss of Income</b><br>
After my stroke, I faced the significant challenge of losing my primary source of income. This sudden loss has made it extremely difficult to cover daily living expenses.<br><br>

<b>Debts</b><br>
I am burdened with over a million in debts, including an 7 lakh debt to RCBL company. This immense financial strain has caused substantial stress, not only for me but also for my entire family. The pressure of these debts is overwhelming and has made our financial situation precarious.<br><br>
<b>Daily Survival</b><br>
With no steady income and overwhelming debts, even basic survival has become difficult. Affording necessities such as food and other utilities has become a daily struggle, adding to the already high levels of stress and anxiety.<br><br>

<b>Paying Back Debts</b><br>
Paying back the debts seems almost impossible under the current circumstances. The constant worry about how to repay these debts while trying to manage day-to-day expenses is a persistent source of distress for me and my family.<br><br>

<b>No Equipment for Exercise</b><br>
Access to proper exercise equipment has been limited, making it difficult to perform necessary physical therapy exercises at home.<br><br>


<b>No Mobile Data to Stay Engaged</b><br>
Lack of mobile data has hindered my ability to stay connected and engaged, leading to feelings of boredom and isolation.<br>
